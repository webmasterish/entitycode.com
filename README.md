This is the original version of [EntityCode.com][entitycode.com url] 
that I built in 2009.


## Todo

Hopefully I'll have the time and make version 2 which would include the following:

- [ ] Create branding (logo and co)
- [ ] Redesign the layout so that it becomes mobile friendly
- [ ] Make it a PWA
